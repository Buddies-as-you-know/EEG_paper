abstract={Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a potential technology for active neurorehabilitation of stroke patients by complementing the conventional passive rehabilitation methods. Research to date mainly focused on classifying left vs. right hand/foot MI of stroke patients. Though a very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement directions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI, the experiments were conducted on healthy subjects. Our work analyzes MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decodes the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient's affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke-affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. The synchronization measure called Phase Locking Value (PLV), extracted from EEG, is the neuronal signature used to decode the directional movement of the MI task. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis on Mu and Beta frequency bands of EEG is done to select the time bin corresponding to the MI task. The dissimilarities between the two directions of MI tasks are identified by selecting the most significant channel pairs that provided maximum difference in PLV features. The training protocol has an initial calibration session followed by a feedback session with 50 trials of MI task in each session. The feedback session extracts PLV features corresponding to most significant channel pairs which are identified in the calibration session and is used to predict the direction of MI task in left/right direction. An average MI direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients.},

abstract = {Abstract Although there is ample evidence that motor imagery activates similar cerebral regions to those solicited during actual movements, it is still unknown whether visual (VI) and kinesthetic imagery (KI) recruit comparable or distinct neural networks. The present study was thus designed to identify, through functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 Tesla in 13 skilled imagers, the cerebral structures implicated in VI and KI. Participants were scanned in a perceptual control condition and while physically executing or focusing during motor imagery on either the visual or kinesthetic components of an explicitly known sequence of finger movements. Subjects' imagery abilities were assessed using well-established psychological, chronometric, and new physiological measures from the autonomic nervous system. Compared with the perceptual condition, physical executing, VI, and KI resulted in overlapping (albeit non-identical) brain activations, including motor-related regions and the inferior and superior parietal lobules. By contrast, a divergent pattern of increased activity was observed when VI and KI were compared directly: VI activated predominantly the occipital regions and the superior parietal lobules, whereas KI yielded more activity in motor-associated structures and the inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that VI and KI are mediated through separate neural systems, which contribute differently during processes of motor learning and neurological rehabilitation.

abstract = {The quantification of spectral components of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays a crucial role in various clinical and scientific real-time applications for brain–computer interface (BCI) systems. For effective implementation of such systems identification of motor imagery (MI) signals from the frequency patterns obtained from various brain oscillations play a key role. The main objective of this chapter is to perform a comparative analysis of various feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms that are best suited for obtaining the MI signals. Linear features such as power spectral density, band power, as well as mean and maximum power of MI signals are analyzed along with some nonlinear features such as correlation coefficient and approximate entropy. An attempt has been made to check the different linear and nonlinear features from the {EEG} signals. These features are then fed to different classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to determine the best features providing maximum separability between different classes. In order to further enhance the classification accuracy, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based SVM classifier is implemented. Band power features exhibit best performance over all other feature extraction techniques having a classification accuracy of 87.78% and 94.44% using SVM and PSO-SVM classifiers, respectively, for the BCI dataset. The case studies and results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach for real-time neuro-aid applications such as in moving a wheelchair or a robotic arm and other prosthetic devices. Also as the existing algorithms sometimes prove to be computationally slow, therefore, optimization techniques used may aid in enhancing the speed and accuracy of the systems.}

ABSTRACT={Background: Realization of online control of an artificial or virtual arm using information decoded from {EEG} normally occurs by classifying different activation states or voluntary modulation of the sensorimotor activity linked to different overt actions of the subject. However, using a more natural control scheme, such as decoding the trajectory of imagined 3D arm movements to move a prosthetic, robotic, or virtual arm has been reported in a limited amount of studies, all using offline feed-forward control schemes.Objective: In this study, we report the first attempt to realize online control of two virtual arms generating movements toward three targets/arm in 3D space. The 3D trajectory of imagined arm movements was decoded from power spectral density of mu, low beta, high beta, and low gamma EEG oscillations using multiple linear regression. The analysis was performed on a dataset recorded from three subjects in seven sessions wherein each session comprised three experimental blocks: an offline calibration block and two online feedback blocks. Target classification accuracy using predicted trajectories of the virtual arms was computed and compared with results of a filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) based multi-class classification method involving mutual information (MI) selection and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) modules.Main Results: Target classification accuracy from predicted trajectory of imagined 3D arm movements in the offline runs for two subjects (mean 45%, std 5%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than chance level (33.3%). Nevertheless, the accuracy during real-time control of the virtual arms using the trajectory decoded directly from EEG was in the range of chance level (33.3%). However, the results of two subjects show that false-positive feedback may increase the accuracy in closed-loop. The FBCSP based multi-class classification method distinguished imagined movements of left and right arm with reasonable accuracy for two of the three subjects (mean 70%, std 5% compared to 50% chance level). However, classification of the imagined arm movement toward three targets was not successful with the FBCSP classifier as the achieved accuracy (mean 33%, std 5%) was similar to the chance level (33.3%). Sub-optimal components of the multi-session experimental paradigm were identified, and an improved paradigm proposed.}

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this review is to critically analyze the evidence provided throughout the years regarding the application of motor imagery (MI) in sport performance, focusing on the PETTLEP approach. Among the different MI approaches, in fact, the PETTLEP model takes into account many different domains for increasing the performance of athletes. These domains include physical features, the environment, task-related aspects, timing, learning, emotion, and perspective.},
